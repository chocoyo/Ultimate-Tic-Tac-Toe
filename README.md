# Ultimate-Tic-Tac-Toe
Back in High school computer science class I had classmates who were talking about how they were going to drop the class because they didn't feel like after the time they had spent learning to code they were able to do anything substantial, this was how this project was born!!!

Using only concepts that were taught in a first-year high school computer science course I decided I would show my classmates that we did have the skills to make something meaningful. So, I made the most meaningful thing I could think of at the time, Ultimate Tic Tac Toe!
